# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project simulates a customer churn analysis for a telecommunications company. The goal is to understand the factors leading to customer churn and to predict which customers are likely to cancel their services. This analysis will help identify key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer data to identify factors associated with churn.
- Build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of customer churn.
- Generate visualizations to illustrate churn patterns and influential variables.
- Provide a detailed PDF report with results and recommendations.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install fpdf matplotlib pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn

2. Clone this repository or download the code files.
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook provided in the project folder.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: fpdf, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn

## Results
The project generates visualizations such as churn distribution, monthly charges vs churn, and ROC curve.
The model achieves a reasonable accuracy with metrics like confusion matrix and ROC-AUC score.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **models**: Contains the saved model in .pkl format.
- **reports**: Contains the PDF report with results and analysis.
- **visualizations**: Contains images of the visualizations created during the analysis.

## Next Steps
- Improve model performance by tuning hyperparameters or adding more data features.
- Implement additional visualization techniques for deeper insights.
